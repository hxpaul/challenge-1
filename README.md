# Challenge 1
## the one with all the permutations

We have an array of objects in the form

```
{
  key: 'blah',
  values: [1, 2, 3]
}
```

We want to create an array of objects whereby each possible permutation of value combinations is represented.

See the tests in `__tests__` for examples of the expected output.
